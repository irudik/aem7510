# AEM 7510: Environmental Economics
**Time**: Tuesday and Thursday 2:55-4:10

**Location**: Statler 445

**Office Hours**: Tuesday 12:00-1:00

**Prerequisites**: PhD Microeconomic theory and PhD econometrics, **both are required**.

**Recommended courses**: PhD Macroeconomics

**Credit Hours**: 3

**Auditing**: If you are auditing the course, please let me know so I can add you to the Canvas page. Auditors are required to complete in all research-related assignments.

## Course Objective

The objective of this course is to provide a graduate-level survey of energy and environmental economics to prepare students to conduct original empirical research in the field. Spring 2025 will focus on the micro and macroeconomics of climate impacts, risk, and adaptation.

This is a discussion-based course. Each class period will be focused on a single foundational and/or frontier paper in the environmental economics literature. The objective for each class is to come away with a deep understanding of what the paper does, why it does it, and why the paper is important to our broader understanding of the economics of the environment. All students must read the paper before class. One student will present the paper for 25 minutes. The remaining 50 minutes of class will be spent discussing the paper.


## Integrity of credit

I expect every student in this course to abide by the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity. I strongly encourage collaboration in this course, but each student is responsible for making sure that she or he follows the rules laid out in this syllabus, and with those stated in the Code of Academic Integrity. Any student found to have violated the stated policies on problem sets and papers will receive a zero for that assignment. Multiple violations in a semester may result in failure of the course. The Code of Academic Integrity is available for review here: https://cuinfo.cornell.edu/aic.cfm.

## Grading

- Discussion questions and participation: 20%

## Assignments

### Discussion questions and participation
All students are expected to participate in the discussion about the paper. This includes asking questions, answering questions, and providing comments on the paper. The night before each class, students must submit two questions about the paper. These questions should be thoughtful and help guide the discussion in class. The first question is on smaller, nitty-gritty technical issues (e.g. choice of standard errors or subsamplings), the second is on higher-level conceptual issues (e.g. why is this a big issue to study in environmental economics? what are the consequences of modeling assumption X in the paper?).  The questions should be submitted on Canvas by 8pm the night before class.

### Paper presentations
Each class will have one student present the paper of the day. The presenter will have 25 minutes to present the paper and should be presenting it as if it was their own. The presentation should follow the usual style in economics, I will give an example of this the first day of class. Given their deeper knowledge from putting together the presentation, the presenter will also help to lead the discussion of the paper.

Here is a suggested outline for the presentation:
- Introduction / motivation
- Research question(s)
- Data
- Methods
- Results
- Conclusions

Other suggestions that will improve the presentation:
- Show results using figures when possible
- No more than 25 slides

The presenter will be evaluated on how well they stay within the time limit; and how well they present the paper in terms of clarity, conveying the contribution of the paper, and how the paper was done.


### Paper replication
You will do a replication of Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel (2015). The assignment will entail locating the official replication package, checking whether the replication package works and generates the results in the paper. Look at data cleaning choices, standard errors, and robustness checks. Do they make sense? Are there alternatives that are justifiable? Do they change the results dramatically? Bring in extra data if possible and see if the result still holds when extending the dataset or choosing a different temperature series.

### Research pitches

Two classes will be dedicated to research pitches. Each student will present a 5-minute, 4 slide pitch of a research idea. The pitch should include a brief description of the research question, the data and/or modeling approach that will be used, the empirical strategy, and the expected results. The pitch should be a high-level overview of the research idea. The goal of the pitch is to get feedback from the class on the research idea. The pitch should be submitted on Canvas by 8pm the night before class.

The presentation should use the following structure:

- Motivation, background, important institutional details, etc
- Research question
- Data and/or model
- Empirical strategy and/or modeling strategy

**Note:** You may collaborate with one other student on your research pitches (and final projects) since the vast majority of economics research is collaborative. If you do collaborate, your team must have **two** research pitches but only **one** final project.

### Final research project

The final research project will be an early-stage research paper that is (hopefully) a significant extension of the research pitch. The paper should aim to be a complete research paper that includes -- when relevant -- an introduction, literature review, data, model, empirical strategy, results, and conclusion. It should be at least 15-20 pages in length. The paper should be submitted on Canvas by XYZ.

## Important dates

- Final project proposals due: March 17
- Final project presentations: Last week of class
- Final project due: May 19
